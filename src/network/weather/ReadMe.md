**This is the weather part of the application. I will be using http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Los%20Angeles&appid=13098574849c3ecded8a4fc7d0e2ab4c to check the weather at los angeles (will add more features)**

Using this information, I will recommend what to wear. 


**TO DO** 
1. make an appid for openweathermap for this application. 
2. send email about foss and get unlimited access(hopefully);
